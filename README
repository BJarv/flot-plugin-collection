This is a small collection of flot plugins that I developed as part of a summer project that made use of the flot library.

List of plugins:

  * heatmap - Heatmap graph type
  * events - Event Graphic System
  * snap - Easy time series navigation
  * cacher - Data Cacher
  * axislabels - Axis labels using Raphael.js
  * xgap - Automated x-axis gap insertion
  * selectseries - Selectable series
  * weekdaynames - Customised time period labels
  * autoscale - Additional autoscale types
